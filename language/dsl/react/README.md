# DSL

The `@player-tools/dsl` package provides the primitives and build tools to create Player Asset Component libraries, and statically generate Player JSON content using TSX.

## Asset Component Libraries

Similar to React, Vue, or other component libraries, in order for users to take advantage of the JSX capabilities, they need a library of common components to pull from.

As an asset author, you can create and share a library of `Components` for content authors to import and leverage.
