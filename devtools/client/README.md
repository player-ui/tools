The `@player-tools/devtools-client` exposes the Panel with the ReactPlayer, which is responsible for running content sent by Player devtool plugins on the inspected Player UI instance.

You can check how to use it in the [browser-extension](https://github.com/player-ui/browser-devtools) and [Flipper desktop App client](https://github.com/player-ui/tools/tree/main/devtools/plugins/mobile/flipper-desktop-client).

## Overview

The Devtools client is a part of the Player UI Devtools architecture. It allows you to create custom devtools panels that can be used to debug and inspect your Player UI experiences, using the same plugin system used by other Player UI plugins.

The Devtools client conveniently receives its content from the devtools plugins running into the Player UI in use by the inspected page. This feature allows you to extend the dev tools with custom panels, without the need to create a new extension. You can create your own devtools plugins and use them in the Player UI Devtools Browser Extension.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the architecture of the Devtools client, you can always refer to the detailed information provided in the Devtools Browser Extension README.

## Installation

The Devtools client is available as an npm package. You can install it using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @player-tools/devtools-client
```

```bash
yarn add @player-tools/devtools-client
```

## Usage

The Devtools client is a React component that receives content from devtools plugins running in the Player UI used by the inspected page. It can be used in your React application like any other React component.

```jsx
import { Panel } from "@player-tools/devtools-client";
import type { MessengerOptions } from "@player-tools/devtools-messenger";
import browser from "webextension-polyfill";

const port = browser.runtime.connect();

const communicationLayer: Pick<
  MessengerOptions,
  "sendMessage" | "addListener" | "removeListener"
> = {
  sendMessage: async (message) =>
    port.postMessage({
      tabId: browser.devtools.inspectedWindow.tabId,
      body: message,
    }),
  addListener: (callback) => {
    port.onMessage.addListener(({ body }) => callback(body));
  },
  removeListener: (callback) => {
    port.onMessage.removeListener(callback);
  },
};

root.render(<Panel communicationLayer={communicationLayer} />);
```

We welcome contributions to the Player UI Devtools Browser Extension.

### Local Extension Development
``` bash
cd devtools/plugins/desktop/test-env
pnpm run dev:chrome
```

For local development; Running the above command will create a new `browser-devtools` folder on your desktop. This is where the chrome and firefox extension will live.
If you need to make any changes to the extension; you can modify the `browser-devtools` folder and run `build:chrome` or `build:firefox`

#### Chrome:
To test your extension; go to the `/build` folder within `browser-devtools`. there should be a `chrome-mv3-prod` folder.
Head into your Google Chrome Browser and click on Manage Extensions. Make sure you have Developer mode enabled on the top right and click the "Loan Unpacked" and select the `chrome-mv3-prod` folder.


#### Firefox:
To test your extension within Firefox; go to this url on your Firefox Browser `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
Click on `Load Temporary Add-on` and you will go into the folder called `firefox-mv2-prod` within the `/build` folder of devtools. Here, you will select the `manifest.json` file and that will load the add on into firefox.
